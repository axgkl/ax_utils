# Setting Up Main Branch for GitHub

## âœ… Local Branch Renamed

Your local repository has been successfully renamed from `master` to `main`:

```bash
git branch -m master main  # âœ… Already done
```

## ðŸš€ When You Push to GitHub

### Option 1: New Repository (Recommended)
If this is a new repository, GitHub will automatically use `main` as the default branch when you push:

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/ax_utils.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Existing Repository
If you already have a repository with `master` branch on GitHub:

```bash
# Push the new main branch
git push -u origin main

# Then on GitHub:
# 1. Go to Settings â†’ General â†’ Default branch
# 2. Change default branch from 'master' to 'main'
# 3. Delete the old master branch (optional):
git push origin --delete master
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters

### **GitHub Actions Compatibility**
Your workflows are configured to trigger on both branches:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]  # âœ… Works with both
```

### **Badge URLs**
The badges will automatically work with `main` branch:
```markdown
[![Tests](https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/ax_utils/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)]
```

### **Modern Git Practices**
- `main` is the new standard default branch name
- Most new repositories use `main` by default
- Better alignment with inclusive language practices

## âœ… Ready to Push

Your repository is now configured with:
- âœ… Local branch renamed to `main`
- âœ… GitHub Actions configured for `main` branch
- âœ… Documentation updated
- âœ… Badges ready for `main` branch

You can now push to GitHub and everything will work correctly with `main` as your default branch!

```bash
# Ready to go!
git push -u origin main
```
