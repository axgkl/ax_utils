# ax_utils: uv Migration Complete

## Migration Summary

Your Python project has been successfully migrated to a uv-native structure! Here's what was changed:

### ✅ What's Now uv-Native

1. **Dependency Management**: 
   - Moved from `[project.optional-dependencies]` to `[dependency-groups]` 
   - Using uv's native dependency group format
   - Dependencies are now managed via `uv sync --group dev`

2. **Build System**: 
   - Updated to use `uv build` for distribution packages
   - Still compatible with setuptools for C/C++ extensions
   - Updated build system requirements to setuptools>=61

3. **Configuration**:
   - Added `uv.toml` for uv-specific configuration
   - Updated `.gitignore` to include uv cache directories
   - Cache stored in `.uv-cache/` (project-local)

4. **Development Workflow**:
   - Completely rewritten `justfile` with uv-native commands
   - New commands: `just sync`, `just deps`, `just update`, `just add`, etc.
   - All commands now use `uv run --group dev` for proper environment isolation

### 🚀 Key New Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just sync` | Sync dependencies (replaces `install-dev`) |
| `just deps` | Show dependency tree |
| `just update` | Update all dependencies to latest compatible versions |
| `just add PKG` | Add a new dependency |
| `just add-dev PKG` | Add a new dev dependency |
| `just remove PKG` | Remove a dependency |

### 📁 Files Modified/Added

- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Updated dependency groups and build system
- ✅ `justfile` - Completely rewritten for uv-native workflow
- ✅ `uv.toml` - New uv configuration file
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Updated for uv cache directories
- ✅ `uv.lock` - Already existed, now properly maintained

### 🏗️ C/C++ Extension Support

Your C/C++ extensions are fully supported:
- Build process: `just build` (uses `setup.py build_ext --inplace`)
- Distribution: `just dist` (uses `uv build`)
- All extensions compiled successfully during testing

### 🧪 Testing Verification

✅ Dependencies synced successfully  
✅ C/C++ extensions built without errors  
✅ All functionality tests passed  
✅ Distribution packages built successfully  

### 📦 Build Artifacts Generated

- Source distribution: `ax_utils-3.0.2.tar.gz`
- Wheel package: `ax_utils-3.0.2-cp312-cp312-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new workflow**:
   ```bash
   just clean-all  # Deep clean
   just setup      # Setup from scratch
   just dev        # Run development cycle
   ```

2. **Manage dependencies**:
   ```bash
   just add requests           # Add runtime dependency
   just add-dev black         # Add dev dependency  
   just update               # Update all dependencies
   just deps                 # Show dependency tree
   ```

3. **Development cycle**:
   ```bash
   just build        # Build C/C++ extensions
   just test         # Run tests
   just lint         # Check code quality
   just format       # Format code
   ```

4. **Publishing** (when ready):
   ```bash
   just release      # Prepare release
   just publish-test # Test on Test PyPI
   just publish      # Publish to PyPI
   ```

## 🎯 Benefits of uv Migration

- **Faster dependency resolution** - uv is significantly faster than pip
- **Better dependency management** - Native dependency groups
- **Improved reproducibility** - More reliable lockfile handling
- **Native build support** - Direct `uv build` command
- **Better caching** - Project-local cache directory
- **Simplified workflow** - Single tool for most Python operations

Your project is now fully migrated to uv while maintaining all existing functionality, including your C/C++ extensions and development workflow!
