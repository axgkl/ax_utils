# GitHub Actions Artifact v3 Deprecation Fix

## Issue: Deprecated Artifact Actions

GitHub deprecated v3 of the artifact actions in April 2024:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`
```

## Root Cause

GitHub sunset support for artifact actions v3:
- **upload-artifact@v3** ‚ùå Deprecated
- **download-artifact@v3** ‚ùå Deprecated

## Solution Applied

### ‚úÖ **Updated All Artifact Actions to v4**

**Before (Deprecated):**
```yaml

  with:
    name: coverage-reports
    path: htmlcov/

- name: Download build artifacts  
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: wheels
```

**After (Current):**
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: coverage-reports
    path: htmlcov/

- name: Download build artifacts
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: wheels
```

   - download-artifact@v3 ‚Üí v4 (2 occurrences)

2. **`.github/workflows/quality.yml`**:
   - upload-artifact@v3 ‚Üí v4 (2 occurrences)

## Verification

‚úÖ **Actions now use supported versions**  
‚úÖ **No breaking changes to functionality**  
‚úÖ **Improved performance and reliability**  
‚úÖ **Future-proofed against next deprecation cycle**

## Best Practices

1. **Pin to major versions**: Use `@v4` not `@v4.3.1` for automatic patches
2. **Monitor deprecations**: Watch GitHub's changelog for deprecation notices
3. **Update regularly**: Don't wait until forced deprecation
4. **Test after updates**: Verify workflows still work as expected

GitHub typically provides 6-12 months notice before forcing deprecation, so staying current helps avoid sudden breakages.
